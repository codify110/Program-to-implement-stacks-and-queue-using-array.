# Program-to-implement-stacks-and-queue-using-array.
## Approach:
Implement the following operations (Functions) with 
menu driven Approach. <br />
1) Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow
condition.  <br />
2) Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order
in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow
condition.  <br />
3) Peek or Top: Returns top element of stack.  <br />
4) isEmpty: Returns true if stack is empty, else false.
